# Credit-Card-Check-Using-Luhn-s-Algorithm
This code is designed to receive an input from the user for a credit card number. Then it will run a checksum using Luhn's algorithm. If the credit card is not valid, the output will be as such, else if it is valid, the code will then determine the type of credit card (VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX).
